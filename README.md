# Pure CSS, HTML, JS for Tabs Panel navigation OR content tabs for UI segments !

Tab panel navigation and content nesting with native HTML, CSS and JS. No frameworks, no libraries, no radio button hacks ! ALL in pure HTML and basic JS code. Extensible and flexible for content nesting into tabs, including lazy loading content into tab containers or generating content into the separate tabs.  Elegant, simple and as easy as HTML.


Very much perfect for the UI of HTML web apps, or when the content has multiple layers that we
need to layer with tabs that are scroll sticky or nested within other content.

A modern, standalone implementation of accessible, JavaScript-driven tabs. This project demonstrates how to build a flexible and feature-rich tab component using modern web standards, moving away from outdated hacks.

## üöÄ Features

-   **‚úÖ JavaScript-Driven:** No more "radio button" or `:target` hacks. Logic is handled cleanly in JavaScript with no external dependencies.
-   **‚ôø Fully Accessible:** Implements WAI-ARIA patterns, including `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, and `role="tabpanel"`, along with full keyboard navigation.
-   **‚å®Ô∏è Roving `tabindex`:** An efficient and intuitive keyboard tabbing experience that only focuses the active tab.
-   **üé® Themable & Responsive:** Uses CSS Custom Properties for easy light/dark mode theming and is fully responsive.
-   **ü™Ü Nested Tabs:** The architecture gracefully supports nesting tab components within each other.
-   **üõ†Ô∏è Live Code Editor:** Includes a built-in dialog to view, edit, and preview the component's code in real-time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The core mechanism is simple and effective:

1.  A JavaScript function, `setupTabComponent`, is initialized for each `.tabs-container` element.
2.  It listens for `click` and `keydown` events on the tab list to manage tab selection.
3.  When a tab is activated, the script:
    -   Toggles an `.active` class for CSS styling.
    -   Updates `aria-selected` to inform assistive technologies.
    -   Modifies `tabindex` attributes to implement a "roving tabindex" for seamless keyboard navigation.
4.  All visual styling and animations are handled purely by CSS, targeting the `.active` class.

This approach keeps the HTML semantic, the CSS straightforward, and the JavaScript minimal and focused.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

This is a standalone project‚Äîno build process or dependencies are needed. To use it, simply open `index.html` in your browser.

To integrate the component into your own project, follow these steps:

### 1. HTML Structure

Copy the HTML structure below. The script automatically initializes any element with the `.tabs-container` class.

```html
<!-- The main container for the tab component -->
<div class="tabs-container">
    <!-- The container for tab buttons (labels) -->
    <div class="tab-group" role="tablist" aria-label="Example Tab List">
        <button id="label-for-panel-1" class="tab-label-base active" role="tab" aria-controls="panel-1" aria-selected="true" tabindex="0">Tab One</button>
        <button id="label-for-panel-2" class="tab-label-base" role="tab" aria-controls="panel-2" aria-selected="false" tabindex="-1">Tab Two</button>
    </div>

    <!-- The container for the tab content panels -->
    <div class="tab-content-container">
        <div id="panel-1" class="tab-content active" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="label-for-panel-1">
            <p>Content for the first tab.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="panel-2" class="tab-content" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="label-for-panel-2">
            <p>Content for the second tab.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The `id` attributes for your tab panels (e.g., `id="panel-1"`) and their corresponding labels **must be unique** across the entire HTML document. The script relies on these unique IDs to correctly link buttons to their panels.

### 2. CSS Styles

Copy the necessary CSS from the `<style>` tag in `index.html`:
1.  **Theming Variables:** The `:root` and `html.dark` selectors, which define the color palette.
2.  **Component Styles:** The entire CSS block located between the `/* --- START: TAB COMPONENT STYLES --- */` and `/* --- END: TAB COMPONENT STYLES --- */` comments.

### 3. JavaScript Logic

Copy the `setupTabComponent` function from the `<script>` tag in `index.html` into your project's JavaScript file. Then, initialize it by adding the following line. Ensure your script runs after the DOM has fully loaded.

```javascript
// Initialize all tab components on the page
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    document.querySelectorAll('.tabs-container').forEach(setupTabComponent);
});
```

## ‚ôø Accessibility Details

Accessibility is a cornerstone of this project. The implementation strictly follows the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) for Tabs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabpanel/).

-   **Roles:** Correctly uses `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, and `role="tabpanel"`.
-   **ARIA Attributes:** Manages `aria-controls`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-labelledby` to create a clear relationship between tabs and panels.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:**
    -   `ArrowRight`/`ArrowLeft`: Navigate between tabs.
    -   `Home`: Go to the first tab.
    -   `End`: Go to the last tab.
-   **Focus Management:** The active tab is always focusable (`tabindex="0"`), while inactive tabs are removed from the tab order (`tabindex="-1"`), a technique known as roving tabindex.
